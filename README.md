# 📊 Statistics for Data Science: Sales Dataset Exploration

Welcome to my data science project focused on applying **statistical methods** to a simulated sales dataset. This notebook explores key concepts covered in the O'Reilly book *Practical Statistics for Data Scientists*, including EDA, sampling, regression, classification, and statistical machine learning — with an emphasis on **insight over complexity**.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is structured into the following sections:

1. **Dataset Creation & Preparation**  
   A synthetic sales dataset was generated with features such as revenue, quantity, product category, store, and region.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   We explored sales trends across categories, revenue patterns, and created visualizations such as heatmaps.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   We introduced useful variables like `Avg_Sale_Per_Unit` and `Sales_Per_Store` to enhance model interpretability.

4. **Random Sampling**  
   Demonstrated how random and stratified sampling help reduce bias while preserving structure in the data.

5. **Experimental Design**  
   Simulated an A/B test to evaluate the effect of a price change on product revenue using t-tests.

6. **Regression Analysis**  
   Built a regression model to estimate revenue based on product and sales features, checking for linearity and residual behavior.

7. **Classification Techniques**  
   Used Logistic Regression and KNN to classify high vs low revenue, plotted ROC curve and evaluated model performance.

8. **Statistical Machine Learning**  
   Applied statistical ML methods that balance interpretability and predictive power.

## 📚 Objective

The goal of this notebook is to **practice and apply core statistical principles** in a machine learning context — without diving deep into black-box models. It’s aimed at understanding patterns, validating assumptions, and communicating insights with confidence.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for regression, classification)
- SciPy (for t-tests)
- GitHub (version control)

## 📌 Future Additions

- Add blog post based on this notebook
- Explore time-series decomposition per product category
- Try statistical monitoring (Evidently AI, etc.)
